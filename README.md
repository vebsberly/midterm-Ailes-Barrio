Dmitry is a popular name in Russian-speaking cultures and has variations such as Dmitri, Dmitriy, or Dmitrii.
* Ike-scan
  * "Ike-scan" is a tool used to discover and analyze IPsec VPN servers on a network by sending specialized packets and analyzing responses. It helps identify potential security issues or misconfigurations in VPN implementations.
* Legion (root)
  * The root "legion" comes from the Latin word "legio," which originally referred to a large military unit in the ancient Roman army, typically consisting of several thousand soldiers. Over time, the term "legion" has taken on broader meanings, often implying a large, organized group or assembly of individuals with a common purpose or goal. In modern usage, it can refer to a multitude, a vast number, or a powerful collective force.
* Maltego (installer)
  *  Maltego is a software for gathering and visualizing information. Its installer helps users set it up on their computers.
* Netdiscover
  * Netdiscover is a network scanning tool used for discovering devices connected to a network. It operates by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests and analyzing responses to determine active hosts on the network. Netdiscover can be useful for network administrators and security professionals to identify devices and potential vulnerabilities within a network.
* Nmap
  * Nmap is a versatile network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a map of the network. It can perform tasks such as port scanning, service version detection, and operating system detection. Nmap is commonly used by network administrators, security professionals, and ethical hackers for network inventory, monitoring, and security assessments.
* Recon-ng
  * Recon-ng is a powerful open-source reconnaissance framework used by cybersecurity professionals for information gathering and reconnaissance during security assessments. It provides a modular and extensible interface for conducting various tasks such as DNS enumeration, OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) gathering, and reconnaissance against web applications. Recon-ng supports a wide range of modules and can be customized to suit specific reconnaissance needs.
* Spiderfoot
  * SpiderFoot is an open-source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool used for reconnaissance and information gathering. It automates the process of collecting data from various sources on the internet to generate comprehensive reports about targets such as IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and other entities. SpiderFoot scans multiple data sources including search engines, social media platforms, and public databases to gather information relevant to cybersecurity investigations, threat intelligence, and digital footprint analysis.
