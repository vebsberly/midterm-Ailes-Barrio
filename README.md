## Vulnerability Analysis ##
_**Vulnerability Analysis**_ encompasses the systematic identification, assessment, and prioritization of potential weaknesses within a system, network, or application. Through steps such as automated scanning, manual inspection, and analysis of security advisories, vulnerabilities are identified and evaluated based on severity, likelihood of exploitation, and potential impact. Following prioritization, mitigation strategies are developed and implemented, including patch application, configuration changes, and security control deployment. Verification of mitigation measures ensures effectiveness, while continuous monitoring remains vital for staying ahead of emerging threats and maintaining robust security posture. Ultimately, vulnerability analysis enables organizations to proactively address security weaknesses, reduce the risk of breaches, and enhance overall system security.
* Legion (root)

For example, each item can be either a single entry or a file containing multiple entries. Additionally, a combination file format allows the user to refine their target listing. * Modular design. Each service module exists as an independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are necessary to the core application in order to extend the supported list of services for brute-forcing.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gYq0SSGxr4)
